## Fixed
    - Initial deployment to Heroku failed
        - Upon opening the app in Heroku for the first time after initial deployment, an Application Error was presented. By using the 'heroku logs --tail' command in the terminal, I was able to determine that I had written my application name in the wrong format in Line 1 of the Procfile (I had included underscores in the wsgi file name). I corrected the filename to 'thepaperlounge.wsgi' and upon re-opening the app after commiting the change, the Django successful install page was displayed.
